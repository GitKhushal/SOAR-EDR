# SOAR-EDR

## Objective

This project aims to automate the response to malware infections on endpoints using SOAR and EDR technologies. When a malware threat is detected, the system swiftly isolates the affected computer from the network to prevent further spread and damage. This automated response enhances security by reducing response time and minimizing human intervention, thus protecting the network ecosystem more effectively.
