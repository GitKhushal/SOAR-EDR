Steps: 

1. - It is clearly visible that the computer is connected to the network.
- My VM is continuously pinging google.com throughout the incident (showing the availability of network).

2. - I run the malware (Lazagne.exe) 
- The detection and response rules gets an alert and sends the alert to the slack, email and a simple webpage.
- Slack and Email contain the verbose information of the computer.
- Also in webpage we get the verbose information but we also get an user prompt for the isolation.

3. - If user selects 'YES', the LimaCharlie isolation template isolates the computer and we get the status of isolation and the device name.
- If user selects 'NO', the device remains in the network and sends a message to investigate the computer.

4. After the computer is isolated, we can see it on our LimaCharlie that sensor ID (sid) has been isolated.

5. Going back to the virtual machine (victim), we can see that it no longer pings.

6. You can again connect the computer to the network through LimaCharlie.
